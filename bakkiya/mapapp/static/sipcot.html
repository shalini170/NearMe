                The SIPCOT Industrial Park in Hosur is a major industrial hub developed by the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (SIPCOT) to promote large and medium scale industries in the region.
                It is strategically located near the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border, approximately 40 km from Bangalore, offering excellent connectivity via National Highway 44 (NH-44).
                The park hosts a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, engineering, automotive, pharmaceuticals, watches and jewellery, and export-oriented units.
                Prominent companies operating within or near the SIPCOT complex include TVS Motors, Ashok Leyland, Titan Company, Caterpillar, and Tenneco Automotive.
                SIPCOT provides essential infrastructure, such as roads, water supply (including a new Tertiary Treatment and Reverse Osmosis (TTRO) plant), and power. 
                It also features a dedicated SIPCOT Industrial Innovation Centre (SIIC) to foster technology-driven startups and R&D activities.
